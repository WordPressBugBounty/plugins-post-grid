ComboBlocks is the ultimate Gutenberg extension for building stunning landing pages, blogs, eCommerce stores, niche websites, news portals, and more.

== Description ==

Post Grid has evolved into ComboBlocks! Our team has taken a deep dive into the limitations of existing Gutenberg blocks and page builders, addressing key pain points such as styling, functionality, and usability. Most competing plugins come with excessive, redundant blocks, static elements, and limited customization options.

Through extensive research, we found that our seven specialized blocks can effectively replace 22 blocks from other plugins—meaning you can eliminate unnecessary clutter and achieve a streamlined, performance-optimized experience. With ComboBlocks, less is more.
